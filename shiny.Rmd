This is a shiny implemtation of the Reproducible Data Peer Assessment Project.  Data was used for activity step monitoring.  

The slider allows the user to change the number of days looking at the total number of steps, beginning from 1 to 60.  In cleaning and aggregating the data by number of days, this number changes to 53.

There is another slider, as a work in progress, that displays the number of groups or bins being displayed, based on number of day choice.
